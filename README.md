# Adventofcode.com tries

My tries in [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) with the objective of
experimenting with different programming languages.

This repo will not be updated often, but during the competitive
part of the Advent of Code (read December) you'll probably see more updates.

The quality of code will probably not be as good as someone could expect as I'm
using this as a learning exercise. Don't take this repo as authoritative. 

If you find something interesting or have any suggestion on how to improve
something feel free to get in touch.
