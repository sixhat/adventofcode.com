# Adventofcode.com tries

My tries in [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) with the objective of experimenting with different programming languages.

This repo will not be updated often, and certainly not during the competitive part of the Advent of Code (read December).

The quality of code will probalbly not be as good as someone could expect as I'm using this as a learning exercise. Don't take this repo as authoritative.
